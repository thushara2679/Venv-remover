## Task: Create GUI Application for Virtual Environment Remover (Date: 2025-10-15)
- **Outcome:** Successfully created a complete GUI application with tkinter for managing and deleting unused Python virtual environments. Implemented configurable parameters, selective deletion, and comprehensive testing.
- **Key Files:** venv_remover_gui.py, utils/venv_scanner.py, utils/venv_deleter.py, Test_py/test_venv_scanner.py, Test_py/test_venv_deleter.py, README.md
- **Summary:** Refactored original CLI script into modular architecture with utils/ folder containing scanner and deleter modules. Created GUI with tkinter featuring configuration panel for ROOT_DIR, DAYS_UNUSED, MIN_SIZE_MB, and DRY_RUN settings. Implemented treeview display showing project names and venv details with checkbox selection. Added multi-threaded scanning to prevent UI freezing. Created comprehensive unit tests (13 tests total) that all pass. Followed test-first development approach as per .clinerules requirements.

## Task: Add Requirements.txt Generation Feature (Date: 2025-10-15)
- **Outcome:** Successfully added requirements.txt generation capability to preserve dependency information before deleting virtual environments. This allows easy reinstallation of dependencies when recreating venvs.
- **Key Files:** utils/requirements_generator.py, Test_py/test_requirements_generator.py, venv_remover_gui.py, README.md
- **Summary:** Created requirements_generator.py module with functions to extract installed packages from venvs using pip freeze and save to requirements.txt files in project folders. Added checkbox in GUI to enable/disable requirements generation before deletion (default: enabled). Integrated generation workflow into deletion process with proper status updates and result reporting. Created 7 unit tests for the requirements generator module (all passing). Updated README with reinstallation instructions and troubleshooting. Total test count now at 20 tests (5 scanner + 8 deleter + 7 generator).

## Task: Build Windows Executable (Date: 2025-10-15)
- **Outcome:** Successfully created optimized single-file Windows executable (VenvRemover.exe) at 10.60 MB with no Python dependencies required for end users.
- **Key Files:** build_exe.py, venv_remover.spec, dist/VenvRemover.exe, README.md
- **Summary:** Created build_exe.py automation script that handles PyInstaller installation, spec file generation, and executable compilation. Generated optimized PyInstaller spec file excluding unnecessary modules (matplotlib, numpy, pandas, etc.) to minimize size. Built windowed (no console) single-file executable with UPX compression and binary stripping enabled. Successfully built at 10.60 MB (11,117,073 bytes). Updated README with three installation options: pre-built executable, run from source, and build your own. Executable tested and confirmed working.
- **Prompt:** Create a Python GUI application for managing and deleting unused virtual environments with the following features: tkinter-based GUI with configuration panel (root directory, days unused, min size MB, dry run mode), treeview display showing project names and venv details with checkbox selection, multi-threaded scanning, requirements.txt generation before deletion, comprehensive unit tests (20 tests total), modular architecture with utils/ folder (venv_scanner.py, venv_deleter.py, requirements_generator.py), Test_py/ folder with unit tests, build_exe.py script for creating Windows executable using PyInstaller with optimized settings, complete README documentation, and all code following snake_case naming conventions with proper docstrings.
